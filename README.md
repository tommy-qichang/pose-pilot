Welcome, hackers! This repository is the official starter kit and resource hub for the [**Nano Banana 48 Hour Challenge**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/banana), hosted by **Google DeepMind**. Everything you need to get started, build something incredible, and submit your project is right here.

**Go Bananas!** For 48 hours, starting on September 6, 2025, we are unlocking a special 48-hour free tier of the Gemini API, putting Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview (aka Nano Banana), our state-of-the-art image model, into your hands. In collaboration with Fal and ElevenLabs, we're giving over $400,000 of prizes! We're looking forward to seeing what you build in the next two days!

Nano Banana is about dynamic creation. Edit with words, blend realities, and access Gemini's unique world knowledge. We challenge you to unleash this power. Show us an application that transforms how we interact with visuals and deliver something that wasn't possible before.

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

1.  **Get Your Free API Key**
    *   Follow the **[API Key Guide](./guides/01-getting-your-api-key.ipynb)** to create your API key to access Nano Banana on the Gemini API. 

2.  **Explore the Resources**
    *   Clone this repository to access code examples and check out the external links for inspiration and documentation.

3.  **Submit Your Project on Kaggle**
    *   When you're ready, head over to the **[Official Kaggle Competition Page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/banana)** to submit your project before the deadline.

## 🎯 The Challenge

Your mission is to build a product, application, or demo that showcases one or more of these core strengths. Think beyond simple text-to-image. How can these advanced features create a magical user experience?

Consider applications that:

*   Enhance dynamic storytelling (e.g., consistent character comics).
*   Revolutionize e-commerce (e.g., virtual room placement or product visualization).
*   Automate creative workflows (e.g., personalized marketing assets at scale).
*   Build the next generation of natural language photo editors.

## 🏆 Submission & Judging

Your project will be judged primarily on your video demo. Show, don't just tell! We want to see the "wow" factor, the utility of your application, and the technical skill behind it.

### How to Submit
All submissions must be made through the official competition page:
> **[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/banana](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/banana)**

### Submission Requirements
Your complete Kaggle submission must include:

1.  **🎥 The Video Demo (2 minutes or less)**
    *   An engaging video demonstrating your project. It must be posted publicly (e.g., YouTube, X/Twitter) and viewable without a login.

2.  **🔗 Public Project Link**
    *   A URL to your working product or interactive demo. If a live demo isn't feasible, a link to your public code repository (e.g., GitHub) with clear setup instructions is required.

3.  **✍️ Gemini Integration Write-up (max 200 words)**
    *   A brief description detailing which Gemini 2.5 Flash Image features you used and how they are central to your application.

### Judging Criteria
*   💡 **Innovation and "Wow" Factor (40%)**: How creative and novel is the application? Does it leverage Gemini 2.5 Flash Image in a way that wasn't previously possible?
*   ⚙️ **Technical Execution and Functionality (30%)**: Does the application work? How effectively does it utilize the API's advanced features (consistency, fusion, editing)?
*   📈 **Potential Impact and Utility (20%)**: Does the application solve a real-world problem (creative, commercial, or educational)?
*   🎬 **Presentation Quality (10%)**: Clarity, storytelling, and engagement of the video demo.

For the Special Technology Prize, these same criteria will be applied with a focus on how that specific technology (ElevenLabs) was pivotal in achieving the project's impact and technical excellence.

Developers using a paid API key will pay for all of their usage. To get the free 100 generations, please use a free tier API key.

## 💬 Getting Help & Discussion

All questions, team formation, and discussions will take place on the Kaggle platform. This is the best place to get help from organizers, mentors, and the community.

*   **Ask a question:** Post your technical or general questions for the community and organizers.
*   **Find teammates:** Create a post to look for collaborators.
*   **Share your ideas:** Discuss your project concepts and get feedback.
